## 🕹️ Description

This is a Hangman-style game, but instead of using a stick figure to show lives, I’ve replaced it with bombs. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

At the beginning, the player chooses the category of words they want to guess — either fruits or animals — by clicking the appropriate button. Then, the guessing begins!

Correct letters will appear in the right position on the dashes, while wrong guesses will be shown in a separate box for incorrect letters. The player only has 4 chances, each represented by a bomb.

The game keeps track of the guesses and shows whether the player wins or loses at the end.
